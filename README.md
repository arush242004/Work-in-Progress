# Projects

### This is where I will be uploading Colab notebooks on work-in-progress projects. I only upload the latest version of Colab-notebooks.

# ⋅⋅* *SitarNet (Project Apollo)*
This is a LSTM network that will create sitar music. The initial architecture will be simple, but I plan to augment it by using the 'APOLLO' optimizer paper and using DeepMind's 'PowerPropagation' technique to boost performance, not to mention that I will also derive extra juice from my GPU via some CUDA programming.
